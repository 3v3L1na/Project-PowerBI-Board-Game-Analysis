#   Board Game Analysis 🎲📊

In today's dynamic world of entertainment, understanding and analyzing board games is essential for players, designers, and publishers. That's why our team has conducted a thorough analysis of board game data.

🎯 **Our objective:** To provide a clear and detailed view of the board game landscape, differentiating by characteristics, popularity, and player preferences, in order to support informed decision-making in the game industry. In this project, we explore, transform, and visualize data, seeking significant patterns and trends to offer relevant conclusions about board games. This data analysis project in Power BI focuses on the fascinating world of board games. From a dataset with over 20,000 titles and more than 28 million players, we explore different aspects such as the most played games, the most common game types, their difficulty, the average playing time, and the historical evolution of the sector. The created dashboards allow us to discover popularity patterns, compare well-known titles such as Catan, Carcassonne or Pandemic, and analyze how preferences vary according to the type of game (thematic, abstract, wargames, etc.). This analysis seeks to provide a clear and visually appealing view of the cultural and social impact of board games, increasingly present in our lives as a form of leisure, learning and human connection.

🚀 **Analysis Exploration:** The analysis is presented through an interactive dashboard made in Power BI, composed of the following sheets:

* General information about board games (distribution of games by release year and players): Offers an overview of the distribution of board games over time, allowing filtering by publication year and number of players.
* Ratings and complexity: Explores in detail the ratings of players, playing time and complexity of the games. It also shows a count of domains by game name.
* Game characteristics: Focuses on the analysis of game characteristics, such as complexity, playing time, minimum age and domains.
* Conclusions: Presents a summary of the main findings extracted from the visual analysis.

🔍 **Main Conclusions:** This analysis has allowed us to explore the universe of board games from a broad and detailed perspective. Thanks to data visualization, we have identified which are the most popular games, which genres predominate, how difficulty levels are distributed and how much time people spend playing. We also observed a significant increase in the creation of new games in recent years, which reflects a growing interest in this type of leisure. In conclusion, board games not only entertain: they connect generations, stimulate strategic thinking and promote social interaction. With this project, we better understand what players are looking for and how this form of entertainment has evolved over time.

**Conclusion 1: Board Game Distribution:** An evolution in the number of board games published over the years is observed. It is possible to analyze the number of players participating in board games.

**Conclusion 2: Ratings and complexity:** Player ratings, playing time and game complexity are analyzed in detail. A count of domains by game name is shown.

**Conclusion 3: Game Characteristics:** The analysis focuses on the characteristics of the games, such as complexity, playing time, minimum age of players, and domains.
